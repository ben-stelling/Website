# DNA Extraction ProtocolAAAAAA

To start my blog I'd like to begin with something that seemed quite confusing when I first started researching it. Developing a protocol to extract DNA from protists from the environment was difficult because there were so many confounding variables that need to be accounted for. For one, since the marine protists vary across multiple phyla their cell walls can contain silica (Diatoms), cellulose, or other polysaccharides. Also, my lab generally uses silica filters to filter out plankton from the water column, so I wasn't sure if these are appropriate for DNA extraction from the ocean. I did a bit of research on extracting environmental DNA[USGS pdf] after using the silica filters initially, I found out that polycarbonate filters are generally used to filter out protists from the water column because these filters tend to keep the organisms on the surface of the filter and can dissolve in chloroform, which is a common solvent used during DNA extraction. 

To keep my data consistent and prevent the use of preservative, I filtered out samples right after sampling. This was done within 6 hours of collecting the samples and the water samples were kept cool while in transit (on ice). Then the samples were prefiltered through a 20 micron nylon filter and onto a 0.7 micron polycarbonate filter. I filtered ~500 mL of water for each sample or until the 0.7 micron filter would no longer allow more water to run through it under suction. Now, I was left with two options either freeze the filters in a lysis buffer or just by themselves in a polypropylene tube. I chose to freeze the filters in a lysis buffer. However, I think I should have just flash frozen the filters outside of a buffer or in a buffer not containing CTAB or SDS--like what I did. If I could turn back the clock I would probably follow a concise protocol like the one I found [here] (https://www.protocols.io/view/phenol-chloroform-dna-extraction-from-polycarbonat-ibbcain).The lysis buffer that I used is listed below.

* 500mL of TRIS-HCl, pH 8.0
* 1.4 M NaCl (added 0.7 mol of NaCl)
* 20 mM EDTA (added 10 mmol of EDTA)
* 2% (w/v) CTAB (added 10g of CTAB)
* 0.4 % beta-mercaptoethanol (added 2 mL of B-mercap)
* Adjusted solution to pH 8.0
*

The high salt content helps with the solubilization of globin proteins and is required for the precipitation of DNA

The EDTA is a ligand that binds the Mg ions in the solution that are necessary to inhibit nucleases that can cut up our DNA. 

The CTAB is a non-ionic detergent that will disrupt the lipid membranes of the protist cells of interest. The detergents also disrupt proteins by conferring solubility by binding to non-polar portions with their aliphatic parts and their polar domain allows for the molecules to be soluble in water. It is important to deactivate proteins because of their association with chromatin in the nucleus and their enzymatic activities. SDS is another commonly used detergent in DNA extraction and I'm not sure the pros and cons of the different detergents.

The beta-mercaptoethanol is a reducing agent that will prevent phenolic compounds from oxidizing forming quinones and semiquinones that can form adducts with proteins and nucleic acids because these quinones have more than one reactive group they can cross-link the nucleic acids and proteins globbing them up. We could also use a lower pH for the extraction buffer to prevent this oxidation but a reduction agent works just fine.


A organic extraction followed by centrifuging is the most common way to extract DNA. Phenol:Chloroform mixture is the most common organic extractants used for this extraction with a small amount of isoamyl alcohol added  to avoid foaming in the chloroform.

The phenol is equilibrated with a Tris-HCl aqueous buffer above pH 7.5 (8.0). If the phenol is acidic <7.5 the DNA will partition into the organic layer with the proteins

When precipitating the DNA, generally absolute ethanol or isopropanol is used with a high concentration of a single positive-charged cation (sodium, potassium, lithium, and ammonium NH4+). This is because the isopropal or ethanol lower the dielectric constant of the solution allowing more of the positive cations to interact with the phosphate groups on the DNA making it less soluble and allowing it to precipitate. Aka it lessens the hydration shell around ions found in a pure water environment. Looking at Coulomb's law ![Coulomb's Law](C:/Users/Tyler/website/public/post/2015-07-23-r-rmarkdown/coulombs-law-electric-force.png)

the hydration shell increases the distance between two opposite charges.

#Extraction Protocol

* Samples are frozen in a -20C freezer after submerging the samples in the lysis buffer above.
* Go through 2 freeze/thaw cycles using ethanol and dry ice and a 35C water bath to physically break cells that have a cellulose or silica, etc. cell wall.
* Incubate the samples at 50C for 2 hours to allow CTAB to disrupt their cell membranes
* Add Tris-HCl buffer, pH 9 (10 mM Tris, 100 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA) to saturate phenol.
* Add satured phenol, pH >8 to the mixture about 1/2 the current volume (2.5 mL for 5 mL)
* Cap tubes and invert 10X, allow to sit 5 min
* Add 2.5 mL of Chloroform:isoamyl alcohol (24:1), inverted 10X and allow to sit 5 min
* Centrifuge mixture 1 min @ max speed (___)
* Transfer the top aqueous layer into a sterile Oak-Ridge tube.
* Add 2X the volume (10 mL) of ice-cold absolute ethanol into the tubes
* Add 0.1X total volume (1.5 mL) of 10M ammonium acetate to the tubes
* Mix gently and place tubes in -20C freezer overnight or >1 hour (I did overnight)
* Spin tubes at 10,000 rpm for 35 min.
* Carefully remove supernatant 
* Wash DNA pellet with 1mL COLD 70% ethanol
* Pipet off as much ethanol as you can, then let tubes sit open and dry in fume hood for 3 hours until completley dry
* Suspend DNA pellet in 200 uL of sterile TE buffer (pH 8)
* Measure DNA concentration of the suspension 

Note: It is important to not apply any strong shearing forces as this will shear the DNA and lead to lower quality/lower molecular weight DNA (shorter strands)

# Evaluating DNA Quality and Quantity

Quantity can be determined by the magnitude of certain spectrophotometric measurements, but there are some clues about the purity of the DNA that can be ascertained spectrophotometrically. DNA absorbs UV light at the 260 nm wavelength, which can be used to measure the concentration of DNA in a solution. But, this isn't always a good estimate of the DNA concentration because there are other compounds that absorb in the UV range. For example, at 260 nm RNA and DNA both absorb UV light similarly, so DNA that that is contaminated with RNA has to be determined using agarose gel electrophoresis and then you can treat the sample with RNAse to remove it and then re-extracting the sample. Phenolics and proteins with aromatic amino acids can also absorb UV light with a peak absorption around 280 nm. These contaminants can be detected by calculated the A260/280 ratio and 1.8 = pure DNA and 2.0 = pure RNA. Lower can 1.8 usually indicates protein contamination which can be alleviated by another organic extraction. Also, 1 AU of a 1 cm cuvette = a 50 ug/mL DNA concentration for _E. coli_

Phenolics are difficult to deal with and can be detected by a brown color in the DNA. Polysaccharides can inhibit enzymes in the PCR process and can be seen as a cloudy-white DNA and the trough around 240 being shallower than normal, so we can look at this ratio as well. Polysaccs can be removed via organic extraction or high-speed centrifugation. 

Finally, we need to look at whether the DNA is amenable to biochemical manipulation by PCR or by using a restriction enzyme on the DNA solution. These can be run these in tangent on the same gel
