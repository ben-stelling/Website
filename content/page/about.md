My name is Ben Stelling. I am currently a Ph.D. student studying phytoplankton ecology at UF. I am interested in a bunch of semi-related things that I will use this website to post about.

I have been trying to live a more disciplined life and believe writing out my thoughts and things I am working on will help me in that endeavor. I don't anticipate there will be a horde of people who end up reading this site, but I hopefully some of my posts will be read and have some utility.
